Welcome to Stanford's Undergraduate Physics Journal Club! In Spring 2019, we meet Saturday afternoons at 4pm on the 4th floor of Varian. Anybody of any level of physics knowledge is encouraged to come. Every meeting, one student signs up to give an informal seminar on any physics topic of their choosing, accompanied by snacks and followed by a discussion. The paper for each week is circulated in advance via our [Slack channel.](https://join.slack.com/t/physicsjournalclub/shared_invite/enQtNTkwMjUyNTk1NzYyLTZmZDU1NTVkMDliMzhmNjdmN2Q3MmM0ZjljOGMzYjI0YzAyMTBkNGU1NmE0OWQ4ZDdjOGRlNTI5ZDU0MDY5MjM) We are supported by the [Stanford Society of Physics Students.](https://web.stanford.edu/group/sps/about.htm)

Our objectives are to: 
1. Develop a community of students interested in exploring cutting edge topics in physics together.
2. Provide a no-stress, informal environment for students to practice giving talks to their peers and receive feedback.   
3. Make the notion of "physics research" more accessible to undergraduate students, and act as a medium to spread information about thing like: finding research opportunities, presenting at poster sessions and conferences, writing research papers, and more. 

Join our [Slack and stay up to date on papers and discussions!](https://join.slack.com/t/physicsjournalclub/shared_invite/enQtNTkwMjUyNTk1NzYyLTZmZDU1NTVkMDliMzhmNjdmN2Q3MmM0ZjljOGMzYjI0YzAyMTBkNGU1NmE0OWQ4ZDdjOGRlNTI5ZDU0MDY5MjM)
